      <h1>Furnace vs Heat Pump</h1>

      <p class="intro">Choosing between a furnace and heat pump depends on your climate, budget, and home's heating needs. Both systems provide reliable warmth, but they operate differently and have distinct advantages in Portland's mild maritime climate.</p>

      <h2>How Furnaces Work</h2>
      <p>Furnaces generate heat by burning fuel (gas, oil, or propane) and distribute warm air through ducts. They only provide heating, requiring separate AC for cooling. Traditional furnaces are reliable and effective for cold climates.</p>

      <p>Modern high-efficiency furnaces achieve 95%+ AFUE ratings, converting nearly all fuel to heat. They work well in Portland's mild winters without extreme cold spells.</p>

      <h2>How Heat Pumps Work</h2>
      <p>Heat pumps extract heat from outdoor air and transfer it indoors using electricity. They provide both heating and cooling in one system. Heat pumps are highly efficient but performance decreases in very cold temperatures.</p>

      <p>Modern heat pumps maintain efficiency down to 0°F, making them suitable for Portland's climate. They can provide 3-4 units of heat per unit of electricity consumed.</p>

      <h2>Cost Comparison</h2>
      <p>Furnaces: Installation $3,000-$8,000. Annual operating costs $800-$1,500 depending on fuel type and usage. High-efficiency models cost more upfront but save on fuel bills.</p>

      <p>Heat Pumps: Installation $4,000-$10,000. Annual operating costs $600-$1,200. Lower electricity costs offset higher installation expenses. Dual-fuel systems combine both for optimal efficiency.</p>

      <h2>Efficiency Ratings</h2>
      <p>Furnaces measured by AFUE (Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency). Standard models 80% AFUE, high-efficiency 95%+ AFUE. Gas furnaces most common in Portland due to availability.</p>

      <p>Heat pumps measured by HSPF (Heating Seasonal Performance Factor). Good models 8-9 HSPF, premium models 10+ HSPF. Portland's mild climate maximizes heat pump efficiency.</p>

      <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
      <p>Furnace Pros: Reliable heating, works in extreme cold, familiar technology, can use existing ductwork.</p>

      <p>Furnace Cons: Higher operating costs, no cooling capability, requires fuel storage or delivery, combustion byproducts.</p>

      <p>Heat Pump Pros: Highly efficient, provides heating and cooling, lower operating costs, environmentally friendly, quiet operation.</p>

      <p>Heat Pump Cons: Performance decreases in extreme cold, higher installation costs, may require backup heat source, complex electronics.</p>

      <h2>Portland-Specific Considerations</h2>
      <p>Portland's mild winters (average lows 35-40°F) favor heat pumps over traditional furnaces. Gas availability makes furnaces practical for larger homes. Mild summers mean less AC demand.</p>

      <p>Older homes may have existing ductwork suitable for either system. New construction often includes heat pumps for efficiency. Utility incentives available for both systems.</p>

      <h2>Maintenance Requirements</h2>
      <p>Furnaces: Annual tune-ups, filter changes, vent inspection, combustion analysis. Gas furnaces require professional servicing for safety.</p>

      <p>Heat Pumps: Similar maintenance plus refrigerant checks, defrost cycle testing, electrical component inspection. Generally less maintenance than furnaces.</p>

      <h2>Which is Right for You?</h2>
      <p>Choose furnace if: You live in an area with frequent extreme cold, prefer gas heating, have existing ductwork, or want maximum reliability.</p>

      <p>Choose heat pump if: You want year-round efficiency, have mild winters, prefer electric heating, or want a simpler system. Portland homeowners often benefit most from heat pumps.</p>
