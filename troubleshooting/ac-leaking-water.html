      <h1>AC Leaking Water</h1>

      <p class="intro">Water leaks from air conditioning systems are common problems that can cause extensive water damage if not addressed promptly. Understanding the causes and solutions helps prevent costly repairs and maintains system efficiency in Portland's humid climate.</p>

      <h2>Normal vs. Problem Leaks</h2>
      <p>Air conditioners naturally produce condensation during cooling. This water should drain through designated lines. Problem leaks occur when water escapes containment and damages floors, walls, or ceilings.</p>

      <p>Normal drainage appears as a small puddle under the outdoor unit or steady flow through drain lines. Excessive leaking, dripping from indoor vents, or water stains indicate problems requiring attention.</p>

      <h2>Clogged Condensate Drain</h2>
      <p>The most common cause of AC water leaks is a clogged condensate drain line. Algae, mold, dust, and debris accumulate in the drain pan and tubing, blocking water flow. When the drain clogs, water overflows and leaks.</p>

      <p>Signs include water dripping from the indoor unit, musty odors, or visible standing water in the drain pan. Regular cleaning prevents most clog-related leaks.</p>

      <h2>Dirty Air Filter</h2>
      <p>Clogged filters restrict airflow, causing evaporator coils to become too cold and freeze. Ice formation blocks drainage, leading to water overflow when the ice melts. Replace or clean filters regularly to maintain proper drainage.</p>

      <p>Check filters monthly and clean or replace them every 1-3 months depending on usage and air quality. Dirty filters are a leading cause of AC water leaks.</p>

      <h2>Drain Pan Issues</h2>
      <p>Cracked or damaged drain pans allow water to leak before reaching the drain line. Corrosion from acidic condensate weakens metal pans over time. Physical damage during maintenance can also cause leaks.</p>

      <p>Inspect drain pans during annual maintenance. Replace corroded or damaged pans to prevent water damage to floors and ceilings.</p>

      <h2>Refrigerant Problems</h2>
      <p>Low refrigerant levels cause evaporator coils to freeze, blocking condensate drainage. Leaks in refrigerant lines create both cooling loss and drainage problems. Professional diagnosis and repair are required for refrigerant issues.</p>

      <p>Symptoms include reduced cooling capacity combined with water leaks. Never attempt DIY refrigerant work, as it requires specialized equipment and certification.</p>

      <h2>Blocked Drain Line</h2>
      <p>Drain lines can kink, crush, or become obstructed by debris. Improper installation may leave drain lines without proper slope or venting. External factors like tree roots or insects can block external drains.</p>

      <p>Clear blockages and ensure proper drainage slope. Install drain line filters to prevent future clogs.</p>

      <h2>High Humidity Issues</h2>
      <p>Portland's humid climate increases condensate production. Systems not sized for high humidity may produce more water than drain lines can handle. Poor ventilation exacerbates moisture problems.</p>

      <p>Ensure proper ventilation and consider dehumidifier integration if humidity levels remain high despite AC operation.</p>

      <h2>Emergency Response</h2>
      <p>Shut off the AC system immediately if water leaks are severe. Place towels or buckets to contain water and prevent damage. Contact professional technicians for diagnosis and repair.</p>

      <p>Document damage with photos for insurance claims. Do not operate the system until repairs are complete to prevent further damage.</p>
