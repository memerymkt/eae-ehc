      <h1>AC Making Noise</h1>

      <p class="intro">Unusual noises from air conditioning systems often indicate maintenance needs or potential problems. Understanding different AC sounds helps homeowners identify issues early and prevent costly repairs in Portland's variable climate.</p>

      <h2>Normal AC Sounds</h2>
      <p>Some noise is normal during AC operation. Low humming from the compressor and fan motors, occasional clicking from relays, and gentle airflow through ducts are typical. These sounds indicate the system is working properly.</p>

      <p>Outdoor unit sounds like rushing air or water dripping are normal. Indoor airflow through registers produces soft whooshing sounds during operation.</p>

      <h2>Grinding or Scraping Noises</h2>
      <p>Grinding sounds often indicate bearing failure in motors or blower wheels. Scraping noises suggest contact between moving parts that shouldn't touch. These issues can lead to complete motor failure if not addressed.</p>

      <p>Check for loose fan blades or debris in the blower wheel. Professional inspection identifies worn bearings requiring replacement.</p>

      <h2>Banging or Clanking Sounds</h2>
      <p>Loud bangs suggest loose components or ductwork problems. Clanking indicates metal parts hitting each other, often from loose fan blades or disconnected duct sections.</p>

      <p>Check duct connections and mounting brackets. Vibrating pipes or loose panels can create banging noises. Professional tightening or replacement resolves these issues.</p>

      <h2>Squealing or Screeching</h2>
      <p>High-pitched squealing indicates belt problems or bearing wear. Screeching suggests dry bearings or misaligned pulleys. These sounds worsen over time and indicate imminent failure.</p>

      <p>Check belt tension and pulley alignment. Lubricate bearings if accessible, but professional repair is often required for internal components.</p>

      <h2>Hissing or Bubbling</h2>
      <p>Hissing suggests refrigerant leaks or air escaping from ducts. Bubbling sounds indicate water in lines or drain issues. These require immediate attention to prevent system damage.</p>

      <p>Check for visible leaks around fittings. Clear clogged drains and ensure proper refrigerant charge through professional service.</p>

      <h2>Rattling or Vibrating</h2>
      <p>Rattling indicates loose parts or debris in ducts. Vibrating sounds suggest unbalanced fans or loose mounting. These can cause structural damage if not resolved.</p>

      <p>Secure loose panels and mounting brackets. Balance fan assemblies and clean ducts of debris. Add vibration isolation pads if needed.</p>

      <h2>Whining or High-Frequency Noises</h2>
      <p>Whining suggests electrical issues or capacitor problems. High-frequency sounds indicate motor speed problems or resonance in ductwork.</p>

      <p>Check electrical connections and capacitors. Professional diagnosis identifies motor or electrical component issues requiring repair or replacement.</p>

      <h2>Portland-Specific Considerations</h2>
      <p>Portland's damp climate can cause rust and corrosion leading to unusual noises. Tree pollen and mold can affect air filters and blower components. Regular maintenance prevents noise issues.</p>

      <p>Seasonal temperature changes cause expansion and contraction that can create popping or cracking sounds in ductwork.</p>

      <h2>Diagnostic Steps</h2>
      <p>Note when noises occur - startup, running, or shutdown. Describe sounds accurately to technicians. Check for patterns related to temperature or humidity.</p>

      <p>Inspect accessible components for obvious issues. Clean or replace filters and ensure proper airflow. Professional diagnosis provides accurate identification and repair.</p>
