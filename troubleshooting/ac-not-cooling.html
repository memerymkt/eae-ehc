      <h1>AC Not Cooling: Common Causes and Fixes</h1>

      <p class="intro">When your air conditioner stops cooling properly, it can turn your home into an uncomfortable oven during Portland's hot summers. Understanding the common causes of AC cooling problems helps you diagnose issues and restore comfort quickly.</p>

      <h2>Low Refrigerant Levels</h2>
      <p>Refrigerant leaks are the most common cause of AC cooling problems. Low refrigerant prevents the system from absorbing heat effectively, resulting in warm air output. Signs include hissing sounds, ice formation on coils, and increased energy bills.</p>

      <p>Professional technicians use specialized equipment to detect and repair leaks, then recharge the system with the correct refrigerant amount. Attempting DIY repairs can be dangerous and may void warranties.</p>

      <h2>Dirty Air Filters</h2>
      <p>Clogged filters restrict airflow, reducing the system's ability to cool efficiently. Dirty filters force the AC to work harder, potentially causing compressor damage. Check filters monthly and replace them every 1-3 months depending on usage.</p>

      <p>Clean filters regularly and ensure proper filter size for your system. Poorly fitting filters allow dust to bypass the filter and clog internal components.</p>

      <h2>Faulty Thermostat</h2>
      <p>Malfunctioning thermostats can prevent the AC from receiving cooling signals. Check thermostat settings, batteries, and wiring connections. Digital thermostats may require calibration or firmware updates.</p>

      <p>Test thermostat accuracy by comparing readings with another thermometer. Replace units that show inconsistent temperatures or fail to communicate with the AC system.</p>

      <h2>Electrical Problems</h2>
      <p>Tripped circuit breakers or blown fuses interrupt power to the AC system. Check electrical panels for tripped breakers and reset them if safe. Replace blown fuses with correct amperage ratings.</p>

      <p>Loose electrical connections or damaged wiring can cause intermittent operation. Professional electricians should inspect and repair electrical issues to prevent fire hazards.</p>

      <h2>Compressor Issues</h2>
      <p>Failed compressors are expensive but critical components. Signs include loud noises, vibrations, or complete system shutdown. Compressors may fail due to electrical problems, refrigerant issues, or normal wear.</p>

      <p>Professional diagnosis determines whether repair or replacement is needed. Some compressors can be rebuilt, but replacement is often more cost-effective.</p>

      <h2>Blocked Vents and Registers</h2>
      <p>Closed or obstructed vents prevent cooled air from reaching living spaces. Furniture, rugs, or debris blocking registers reduce airflow and cooling effectiveness.</p>

      <p>Ensure all vents are open and unobstructed. Clean registers regularly to maintain proper airflow throughout the home.</p>

      <h2>Outdoor Unit Problems</h2>
      <p>Dirty condenser coils reduce heat transfer efficiency. Leaves, dirt, and debris accumulate on outdoor units, especially in Portland's forested areas. Clean coils annually to maintain performance.</p>

      <p>Ensure adequate clearance around outdoor units for proper air circulation. Trim vegetation and remove debris that could obstruct airflow.</p>

      <h2>System Age and Maintenance</h2>
      <p>Older systems (10+ years) may experience multiple component failures. Regular maintenance can extend system life but eventually replacement becomes necessary.</p>

      <p>Schedule annual tune-ups to catch potential problems early. Well-maintained systems provide reliable cooling and last longer.</p>

      <h2>Emergency Troubleshooting</h2>
      <p>Perform basic checks before calling professionals. Ensure thermostat is set correctly, filters are clean, and circuit breakers are not tripped. Reset the system by turning it off for 30 minutes then back on.</p>

      <p>Avoid running the system continuously if it's not cooling. This can cause further damage and increase repair costs.</p>
