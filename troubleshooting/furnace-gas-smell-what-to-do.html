      <h1>Furnace Gas Smell: What to Do</h1>

      <p class="intro">Detecting a gas smell from your furnace is a serious safety concern that requires immediate attention. Natural gas, while odorless in its pure form, is intentionally scented with mercaptan to make leaks detectable. Understanding what to do when you smell gas can prevent explosions, fires, and carbon monoxide poisoning in Portland homes.</p>

      <h2>Immediate Safety Response</h2>
      <p>If you smell gas, stop what you're doing and evacuate the building immediately. Do not use any electrical switches, appliances, or phones inside the house, as these can create sparks. Leave the premises and call your gas company emergency line from a safe distance using a neighbor's phone or cell phone.</p>

      <p>Do not re-enter the home until emergency responders declare it safe. Avoid lighting matches, smoking, or using any open flames. These actions can ignite gas vapors and cause explosions.</p>

      <h2>Common Causes of Furnace Gas Smells</h2>
      <p>Gas leaks from faulty connections, cracked pipes, or damaged valves can release natural gas into living spaces. Furnace malfunctions, such as failed gas valves or improper combustion, may also cause gas odors. Overuse of gas during peak demand periods can sometimes result in temporary odors.</p>

      <p>Improper venting or blocked exhaust flues can cause gas to back up into the home. Dirty burners or clogged orifice ports may prevent complete combustion, leading to gas smells. Old or poorly maintained furnaces are more prone to these issues.</p>

      <h2>Furnace-Specific Gas Issues</h2>
      <p>Failed gas valves can leak gas even when the furnace is off. Cracked heat exchangers allow gas to escape into the air stream. Pilot light problems or thermocouple failures can cause gas to flow without ignition.</p>

      <p>Improper gas pressure or regulator failures can result in excessive gas flow. Leaking gas lines in the furnace manifold or burner assembly create dangerous situations. These issues require professional inspection and repair.</p>

      <h2>When to Call Emergency Services</h2>
      <p>Call 911 or your local emergency services immediately if you smell gas. Contact your gas utility company's emergency line (usually posted on your gas bill). Portland General Electric provides 24/7 emergency response for gas leaks.</p>

      <p>Report the emergency even if the smell seems faint. Gas can accumulate in low areas and become dangerously concentrated. Professional technicians use specialized equipment to detect gas levels that may not be noticeable to humans.</p>

      <h2>Preventive Maintenance</h2>
      <p>Annual furnace inspections by licensed technicians can identify potential gas leaks before they become dangerous. Regular cleaning and tune-ups ensure proper combustion and venting. Replace old furnaces that are more prone to gas issues.</p>

      <p>Install gas detectors in furnace rooms and throughout the home as additional safety measures. These devices provide early warning of gas leaks and can alert you even when you're away from home.</p>

      <h2>Professional Inspection Procedures</h2>
      <p>Gas company technicians use sensitive detection equipment to locate leaks. They may use soapy water solutions on connections to identify bubbles indicating gas escape. Electronic gas detectors provide precise measurements of gas concentrations.</p>

      <p>Once leaks are located, professional repairs involve tightening connections, replacing damaged components, or rerouting gas lines. All repairs must comply with local building codes and gas company regulations.</p>

      <h2>Portland-Specific Safety Guidelines</h2>
      <p>Portland residents should be familiar with their gas utility emergency procedures. Keep emergency contact numbers readily available. Know the location of your main gas shut-off valve for use in emergencies.</p>

      <p>During winter months, increased furnace usage can reveal previously undetected issues. Regular maintenance becomes even more critical during cold weather when systems run continuously.</p>
