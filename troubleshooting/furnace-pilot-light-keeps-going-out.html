      <h1>Furnace Pilot Light Keeps Going Out</h1>

      <p class="intro">A furnace pilot light that repeatedly goes out indicates underlying issues that require immediate attention to prevent safety hazards and ensure reliable heating. Understanding the causes and implementing proper solutions can protect your Portland home from carbon monoxide risks and heating failures during cold weather.</p>

      <h2>Understanding Pilot Light Function</h2>
      <p>The pilot light serves as the ignition source for gas furnaces, providing a continuous flame that lights the main burners when the thermostat calls for heat. When the pilot repeatedly extinguishes, the furnace cannot operate, leaving your home without heat and potentially creating safety risks.</p>

      <p>Modern furnaces often use electronic ignition systems that eliminate the need for standing pilot lights, but older systems still rely on them. If your furnace has a pilot light that keeps going out, it signals maintenance needs that should be addressed promptly.</p>

      <h2>Common Causes of Pilot Light Failure</h2>
      <p>Drafty conditions from nearby windows, doors, or vents can extinguish the pilot flame. Strong air currents or wind gusts can blow out the small flame, especially in older homes with poor sealing.</p>

      <p>Dirty or clogged orifices prevent proper gas flow to the pilot, causing weak flames that easily go out. Dust, debris, or corrosion can block the small opening, requiring professional cleaning.</p>

      <p>Faulty thermocouples or flame sensors fail to detect the pilot flame, causing the gas valve to shut off as a safety measure. These safety devices need periodic testing and replacement.</p>

      <p>Low gas pressure or regulator issues can result in insufficient gas flow to maintain the pilot flame. This often indicates problems with the gas line or meter that require utility company attention.</p>

      <h2>Safety Concerns</h2>
      <p>When a pilot light goes out, unburned gas can accumulate in the furnace and surrounding areas, creating explosion and carbon monoxide poisoning risks. Never ignore a pilot light that repeatedly extinguishes.</p>

      <p>Attempting to relight a pilot without proper knowledge can result in gas explosions or fires. Always follow manufacturer instructions and consider professional service for persistent issues.</p>

      <h2>Troubleshooting Steps</h2>
      <p>Check for drafts by observing the pilot flame when opening nearby doors or windows. If it flickers or goes out, improve ventilation or seal gaps around the furnace.</p>

      <p>Inspect the pilot orifice for dirt or debris using a flashlight. Clean gently with a soft brush if visible blockages are present. Avoid using sharp tools that could damage the orifice.</p>

      <p>Test the thermocouple by measuring voltage with a multimeter. A faulty thermocouple should read around 20-30 millivolts when the pilot is lit. Replace if readings are low.</p>

      <p>Verify gas pressure at the manifold with a pressure gauge. Normal pressure should be around 3.5 inches of water column. Contact your gas utility if pressure is outside normal ranges.</p>

      <h2>Professional Solutions</h2>
      <p>Licensed technicians can perform thorough cleaning and adjustment of the pilot assembly. They have specialized tools for cleaning orifices and calibrating gas valves.</p>

      <p>Replacement of faulty thermocouples, gas valves, or pressure regulators requires professional installation to ensure safety and proper operation.</p>

      <h2>Portland-Specific Considerations</h2>
      <p>Portland's damp climate can cause corrosion in gas components, leading to pilot light issues. Regular maintenance becomes even more critical in our humid environment.</p>

      <p>During winter storms or high winds, pilot lights may go out more frequently. Keep emergency heating alternatives available and have your furnace inspected before cold weather sets in.</p>

      <h2>Prevention Strategies</h2>
      <p>Install wind guards around the furnace area to reduce drafts. Ensure proper clearances around the furnace as specified in the owner's manual.</p>

      <p>Schedule annual furnace maintenance to clean components and test safety systems. This preventive approach reduces the likelihood of pilot light failures.</p>
