      <h1>HVAC Water Damage: What to Do</h1>

      <p class="intro">Water damage from HVAC systems can cause extensive property damage and create health hazards if not addressed immediately. Understanding the causes of HVAC water leaks and implementing proper response procedures is essential for protecting your Portland home and preventing mold growth.</p>

      <h2>Common Causes of HVAC Water Leaks</h2>
      <p>Clogged condensate drains cause backup of condensation water, leading to overflow and leaks. Dirty air filters restrict airflow, causing evaporator coils to freeze and thaw, resulting in water damage when ice melts.</p>

      <p>Failed condensate pumps in systems without gravity drainage allow water to accumulate and overflow. Cracked drain pans or damaged condensate lines create leaks that can soak through ceilings and walls.</p>

      <p>Improper installation or maintenance leaves systems vulnerable to water damage. Duct leaks can introduce moisture into walls and ceilings, creating hidden damage over time.</p>

      <h2>Immediate Response to Water Damage</h2>
      <p>Shut off the HVAC system immediately to prevent further water release. Turn off power to the unit at the circuit breaker to avoid electrical hazards. Open windows and doors to improve ventilation and reduce moisture levels.</p>

      <p>Remove standing water using wet/dry vacuums or towels. Avoid using household vacuums that could be damaged by water. Place fans to circulate air and speed drying.</p>

      <p>Document all damage with photos and notes for insurance claims. Contact your insurance company promptly to report the incident and begin the claims process.</p>

      <h2>Professional Assessment and Cleanup</h2>
      <p>Hire certified water damage restoration professionals who understand HVAC-related moisture issues. They use specialized equipment to detect hidden water and prevent mold growth.</p>

      <p>Technicians perform moisture mapping to identify affected areas and guide remediation efforts. They use industrial dehumidifiers and air movers to dry out structures thoroughly.</p>

      <p>Antimicrobial treatments prevent mold and mildew growth during the drying process. Professionals ensure complete moisture removal to prevent secondary damage.</p>

      <h2>Safety Precautions During Cleanup</h2>
      <p>Wear appropriate personal protective equipment including gloves, masks, and eye protection. Avoid contact with contaminated water that may contain bacteria or chemicals.</p>

      <p>Do not use electrical appliances in wet areas until thoroughly dried and inspected. Turn off power to affected circuits to prevent electrical shock hazards.</p>

      <p>Monitor for signs of mold growth and address immediately. Mold can begin developing within 24-48 hours in warm, moist environments.</p>

      <h2>HVAC System Repairs</h2>
      <p>Professional technicians inspect and repair the root cause of water leaks. This may involve cleaning condensate drains, replacing failed pumps, or repairing damaged components.</p>

      <p>Systems are tested thoroughly before reactivation to ensure no leaks remain. Preventive maintenance schedules are established to avoid future water damage incidents.</p>

      <h2>Prevention Strategies</h2>
      <p>Regular maintenance prevents most water damage issues. Annual tune-ups include drain cleaning and system inspections to identify potential problems.</p>

      <p>Install condensate overflow switches that automatically shut down systems if water levels become dangerously high. These devices provide additional protection against catastrophic water damage.</p>

      <p>Monitor humidity levels and ensure proper ventilation to reduce condensation formation. Well-maintained systems operate more efficiently and produce less moisture.</p>

      <h2>Insurance Considerations</h2>
      <p>Most homeowner policies cover water damage from HVAC systems if properly maintained. Document maintenance records to support insurance claims.</p>

      <p>Some policies require professional restoration services for coverage. Understand your policy limits and deductibles before beginning cleanup.</p>
